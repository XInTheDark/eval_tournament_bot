# Chess Coding Challenge (C#) -- Evaluation Tournament
This is a 512 token evaluation tournament, based on the 1024 token [chess coding challenge](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge)!

## How to Participate
Participation works the same way as in the [original challenge](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge),
but instead of submitting the `MyBot.cs` file you now submit the `Evaluator.cs` file, which implements an evaluation function that will be used as part of an existing search implementation.

Once you're happy with your submission, head over to the [Submission Page](https://forms.gle/tKg9gU7BYDS8KWrN9) to enter it into the competition.
You will be able to edit your entry up until the competition closes on *Friday, 27. October 2023, 14:00 CEST*.

## Rules
The rules are very similar to the rules for the original 1024 token challenge, with some additional [modifications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RaZ2WqHxDMJpYWQVPne_PjNJZJiLIJrwSEa6Ju1Zo4g/edit).

## Thanks

Huge thanks to Sebastian Lague for the original Chess Coding Challenge, and to everyone in the Discord server!
